## Polls

JubiVote currently supports:

- Ranked Choice Voting ([Borda Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count)).

## Creating a poll

To avoid excessive traffic and abuse, you have to be invited to participate in a poll before you gain the ability to create your own poll.  If you'd like to try it out, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/jubishop/jubivote/issues) and I will invite you to a poll.
